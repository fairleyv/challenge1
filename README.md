# Horiseon Accessibility challenge

## Description

A challenge in which the homepage of a provided marketing agency requires a reworking of its HTML and CSS in order to improve accessibility. The motivation for this project was to provide a resource to look back at and a way to help build and refine my 
skills as a webdeveloper. This project shined a light on some of the coding pratices that are important for accessibility like semantic HTML and commenting on CSS style sheets for better clarity.
